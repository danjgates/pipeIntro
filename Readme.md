### A simple Nextflow pipeline

This repos function is reproducible support of my 0 to Cloud blog at https://danjgates.github.io/1)-Blog-Introduction/.
If you have [nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io) and the software [ncbi-datasets-cli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/docs/v2/download-and-install/) you should be able to run this pipeline with:

```console
foo@bar:~$ nextflow run danjgates/pipeIntro -r main
```

This is a simple starting point that I expand upon over the course of multiple posts, stay up to date with all the content [here](https://danjgates.github.io/year-archive/)
